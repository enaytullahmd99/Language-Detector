## 🌐 Where to Deploy Your App

### **Option 1: Render (Recommended - FREE & Easy)**

**Why Choose Render:**
- ✅ Free tier available

2. **Create a `Procfile`** (no extension):
   ```
   web: python app.py
   ```

3. **Update `app.py`** - Change the last line from:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True)
   ```
   to:
   ```python
   app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)))
   ```

4. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com and create a new repository

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, make sure you have:

- [ ] `app.py` - Your Flask backend
- [ ] `templates/index.html` - Your frontend
- [ ] `language_detector_model.pkl` - Trained model
- [ ] `vectorizer.pkl` - TF-IDF vectorizer
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [ ] `Procfile` - Process file (for Render/Heroku)
- [ ] `.gitignore` - To exclude virtual environment

**Sample `.gitignore`:**
```
enayat_venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.vscode/
```

## 🎯 My Top Recommendations

### **For Beginners:**
1. **Render** - Best balance of ease and features
2. **PythonAnywhere** - Most beginner-friendly

### **For Quick Testing:**
1. **Railway** - Fastest deployment
2. **Vercel** - Great for showcasing

### **For Production:**

## 🔧 Important Code Changes for Deployment

Update the last few lines in `app.py`:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import os
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)))
```

Add this to the top of `app.py` if not present:
```python
import os
```
